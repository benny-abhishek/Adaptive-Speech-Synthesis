# Adaptive-Speech-Synthesis
A speech synthesizer using Microsoft's SpeechT5 model with capability of adapting to any voice given as input by extracting speaker embeddings using Speechbrain.

# Introduction

Speech synthesis has evolved dramatically with the advent of advanced AI models. This report documents the creation of a personalized speech synthesis tool, focusing on voice adaptation and generation. The project utilizes the Microsoft Speech T5 model for text-to-speech conversion and integrates speaker embeddings extracted via SpeechBrain's spkrec-xvect-voxceleb model. The use of Hugging Face's platform facilitates model exploration, while tools like Praat and Audacity aid in voice recording, preprocessing, and denoising.
